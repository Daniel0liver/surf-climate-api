## Course


This API was developed in the Nodejs course of zero to production with [@waldemarnt](https://github.com/waldemarnt).

- In the course, we use TDD with Jest, Jest Mock, Integration tests, unit tests, adding logs in the application, applying the concept of data cache with the node-cache, documenting the API with Swagger/OpenAPI, API deployment in Heroku, using GitHub workflows to make the CI.
